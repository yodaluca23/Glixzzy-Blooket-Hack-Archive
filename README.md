When Glixzzy reposted their Original GitHub Repository I immediately forked it and reverted the deleted folders so this code is identical to the code immediately before Glixzzy deleted all the folders and put the announcement stating the move to Schoolcheats.net except of course some of the descriptions. You can find the [origanal README here.](https://github.com/yodaluca23/blooket-hack-Before-All-this-Chaos-/blob/main/OLDREADME.md)

If your looking for working Blooket hacks I suggest you take a look at Minesraft2's repo [here](https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-Cheats).
